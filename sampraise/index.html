Let the weak say

I am strong

Let the discouraged say

I am encouraged

Let the weary heart say

I am not giving up


There is much hope for this country Nigeria

Dear Nigeria
I believe so much in you
I won't stop or doubt your capabilities for once.
I am not dismay or weakened by the bad things 
people say about you.
Definitely I know you will bounce back beyond 
my expectations

I love you so so so so much dear Nigeria

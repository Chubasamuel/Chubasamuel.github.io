Why does the alarm not come on even though I have unfinished goals? -</span>
<span class="bettertoday_faq_ans"> The alarm should come on every day, as long as you have unfinished "daily" goals. 
When it is time for the alarm, and there is no any unfinished daily goals, the alarm will determine whether it is appropriate to ring for the weekly goals; if the criteria to ring for the weekly goals is not met, it will check the criteria to ring for the monthly goals, if none is met, the alarm returns and does not ring.
</span><span id="bettertoday_faq_alarmcriteria">
<h3>Criteria - for daily goals alarm - </h3>
<p>(1) There is one or more unfinished daily goals
</p><p>(*) The alarm comes on every day if there is any unfinished daily goals for the day.
</p>
<h3>Criteria - for weekly goals alarm - </h3>
<p>(1) There is no unfinished daily goal
</p><p>(2) The current day of week(between 1-7) is directly divisible by 2 without remainder. 
</p><p>(*) This ensures the weekly goals alarm only rings weekly if necessary ,three times only.
</p>
<h3>Criteria - for monthly goals alarm -</h3>
<p>(1) There is no unfinished daily goal
</p><p>(2) The current day of month is directly divisible by 7 without remainder. 
</p><p>(*) This ensures the monthly goals alarm only rings monthly if necessary ,four times only.
</p>
<p id="bettertoday_faq_after_criteria">You will see alarm or notification normally for all of the daily, weekly, and monthly goals if any of the criteria is met.

<span class="heading_label">USING THE APP</span>

Opening the app shows the list of currently imported projects being worked on; the list may be empty if you have no projects imported yet.<br /><br />
Swiping a project to the right exports the project detail as a formatted project detail file in <b>.txt</b> format, so you can share it with others, or keep it for later.<br /><br />
Swiping a project to the left attempts deleting it after confirming the action from the user.

</div>

<div class="info_section">
<span class="heading_label">IMPORTING A NEW PROJECT</span>
There are three approaches to importing a project, and you can choose to use any of them, viz:<br /><br />
1. Using the <a class="normal_link" href="importer/wysiwyg">WYSIWYG</a>( What you see is what you get )  editor.<br />
2. Using the <a class="normal_link" href="importer/form">form</a> type of import<br />
3. Importing a <a class="normal_link" href="importer/formatted_file">formatted questionnaire</a> or project detail
</div>

<div class="info_section">
<span class="heading_label">FILLING A RESPONSE</span>
Clicking a project from the home screen directs you to the filler screen, where you can fill the responses for your project.<br /><br />
Each response page corresponds to a complete questionnaire response, or a proforma row, or a row of Excel file.<br /><br />
The responses you fill are automatically saving as you fill, so there's no save button.<br /><br />
When you're through filling a page, swipe left or right to the previous or next page, to fill another response.<br /><br />
The response pages are currently limited to 1000. If your sample size exceeds 1000, we advise you import the same project with a different name, so you can continue filling the responses over 1000.
</div>

<div class="info_section">
<span class="heading_label">JUMPING TO A RESPONSE PAGE</span>
Clicking the Response page {number} label shows the prompt to enter the page number to jump to.<br /><br />
Long-clicking same label shows the prompt to clear the responses filled for that particular response page.

</div>

<div class="info_section">
<span class="heading_label">EXPORTING PROJECT FILLED RESPONSES</span>
Clicking the Export button on each project exports the actual responses filled for that project. <br /><br />
A project could be exported in coded or non-coded form.<br /><br />
Checking or unchecking the checkbox at the top of the home screen specifies whether you want the data exported to be non-coded or coded, respectively.<br />
Default export mode is non-coded.  <br /><br />
When exporting as coded, the variable and value labels are also automatically written in separate Sheets (called variables_labels and values_labels) in the same Workbook of the Excel file, so you can easily copy them and import to SPSS (If you would be using SPSS for your data analysis) 

</div>

<div class="info_section">
<span class="heading_label">HOW DATA IS CODED</span>
In cases of questions with one or more selectable options, the first option is coded as 1, second option as 2, third option as 3, etc.<br /><br />
Questions that are not with options (e.g freeform questions) are not coded.
